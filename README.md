# Heaps

This is just some practise for heaps and getting muscle memory for C++ heaps in my brain. 

Generally working up and cranking the complexity with each one. The main reason is just so I can 
get the muscle memory for working with the extra boilerplate, especially when its a min heap or a heap
with a custom comparator, and you use a non integer (i.e a whole struct) as the heap element.
