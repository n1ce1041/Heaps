## Beginner-Level Exercises

### Simple Min-Heap Creation

1. Create a min-heap of integers and add the numbers 10, 5, 20, and 15.
Extract the minimum value from the heap until it's empty.
Simple Max-Heap Creation

2. Create a max-heap of integers and add the numbers 7, 3, 12, and 8.
Extract the maximum value from the heap until it's empty.
Custom Comparator

3. Create a min-heap of integers using a custom comparator (e.g., sorting based on absolute value).
Heap Initialization

4. Initialize a min-heap with an existing vector of integers (e.g., {4, 1, 7, 8, 5}).
Extract elements in sorted order using the heap.



### Intermediate-Level Exercises

1. Heap with Pairs

Create a min-heap of pairs where the first element is an integer (value) and the second is a string (name).
Add items like (10, "Alice"), (5, "Bob"), (20, "Charlie").
Extract elements in order of the first value.

2. Top-K Largest Elements

Given a large unsorted array, find the top 
𝐾
K largest elements using a min-heap.

3. Merge K Sorted Arrays

Given 
𝐾
K sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array using a heap.

4. Kth Smallest/Largest Element

Find the 
𝐾
K-th smallest or largest element in an unsorted array using a heap.
